\begin{abstract}

The purpose of this document is to act as an exploratory look into the Black Scholes model, a mathematical model which seeks to explain the pricing behavior of financial derivatives. This model is most often used for pricing options.

The model was proposed by Black and Scholes in 1973, and gave theoretical support for trading options to hedge positions, a practice that was uncommon due to the lack of solid mathematical support. From this model, we are able to calculate the ideal price of an option using numerous availiabe factors. There are many different variations on this model, all of which seek to improve the base model in some way. These improvements, however, often come at the cost of a massive increase in mathematical complexity

This document will focus on the basic model, to serve as an educational jumping off point.

\section{Notation}
As in all financial models, there is some notation involved within the model.

\begin{itemize}
 \item[] C = Call option price 
 \item[] S = Current stock price
 \item[] K = Strike price of the option
 \item[] r = Risk-free interest rate
 \item[] $\sigma$ = Volatility
 \item[] t = Time to option maturity
 \item[] N = normal cumulative distribution
\end{itemize}
